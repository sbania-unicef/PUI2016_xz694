A. The null and alternative hypotheses are correct. The hypotheses include “equal to” and “shorter than” and focus on average. </br></br>
B. The data didn’t support the project well. Data including trip durations of two different types of customers have been extracted from the dataset. That’s a good way of analysis. However, there are many lines of data and only part of them are shown. Therefore, further analysis should be done so that the information is shown clearly and completely. Bar charts are good choices, especially for normalized bar charts, because the numbers of customers in two types may be different. Most importantly, a conclusion is needed (whether the hypotheses is true or not).</br></br>
C.Z-test is a good choice, since the average value of two samples need to be compared and there are lots of data(>>30). According to law of large numbers, the population follows normal distribution when there are lots of data, so we can perform Z-test.</br>
