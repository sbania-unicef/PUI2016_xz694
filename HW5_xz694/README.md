### Assignment 3: Null Hypothesis formulating exercises.
####1. "Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?"

Null hypothesis: Within a 3-month period, people who go on diets lose the same or less amount of weight than people who exercise.

Formula: W<sub>before</sub> is a person's weight before the experiment starts, W<sub>after</sub> is the weight after a 3-month period. The expression of the null hypothesis is (W<sub>before</sub> - W<sub>after</sub>)<sub>diet</sub> <= (W<sub>before</sub> - W<sub>after</sub>)<sub>exercise</sub>

####2. "Do Americans trust the president?"

Null hypothesis: Among people who participated in the said poll, Democrats trusted the president(Bill Clinton) equally as or less than Republicans.

Formula: D<sub>poll</sub> and R<sub>poll</sub> are the numbers of Democrasts and Repblicans surveyed respectively. D<sub>trust</sub> and R<sub>trust</sub> are the numbers of Democrasts and Repblicans who responded yes to the question respectively. The expression of the null hypothesis is D<sub>trust</sub> / D<sub>poll</sub> <= R<sub>trust</sub> / R<sub>poll</sub>

####3. "Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking."

Null hypothesis: After one month of experiment, smokers who use nicotine patches have the same or a lower cessation rate than those who use a placebo patch.

Formula: N<sub>nicotine</sub> and N<sub>placebo</sub> are the numbers of smokers assigned with nicotine and placebo patches respectively before the experiment. Q<sub>nicotine</sub> and Q<sub>placebo</sub> are the numbers of smokers who were assigned with nicotine and placebo patches and successfully quit smoking after the experiment, respectively. The expression of the null hypothesis is Q<sub>nicotine</sub> / N<sub>nicotine</sub> <= Q<sub>placebo</sub> / N<sub>placebo</sub>

####4. "Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnangt woman."

Null hypothesis:
