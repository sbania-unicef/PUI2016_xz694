### Assignment 3: Null Hypothesis formulating exercises.
####1. "Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?"

Null hypothesis: Within a 3-month period, people who go on diets (test sample) lose the same or less amount of weight than people who exercise (control sample).

Formula: W<sub>before</sub> is a person's weight before the experiment starts, W<sub>after</sub> is the weight after a 3-month period. The expression of null hypothesis is (W<sub>before</sub> - W<sub>after</sub>)<sub>diet</sub> <= (W<sub>before</sub> - W<sub>after</sub>)<sub>exercise</sub>

####2. "Do Americans trust the president?"

Null hypothesis: Among people who participated in the said poll, Democrats trusted the president(Bill Clinton) equally as or less than Republicans.

Formula: D<sub>poll</sub> and R<sub>poll</sub> are the numbers of Democrasts and Repblicans surveyed respectively. D<sub>trust</sub> and R<sub>trust</sub> are the numbers of Democrasts and Repblicans who responded yes to the question respectively. The expression of null hypothesis is D<sub>trust</sub> / D<sub>poll</sub> <= R<sub>trust</sub> / R<sub>poll</sub>
