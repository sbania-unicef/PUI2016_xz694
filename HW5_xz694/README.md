### Assignment 3: Null Hypothesis formulating exercises.
####1. "Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?"

Null hypothesis: Within a 3-month period, people who go on diets lose the same or less amount of weight than people who exercise.

Formula: W<sub>before</sub> is a person's weight before the experiment starts, W<sub>after</sub> is the weight after a 3-month period.
The expression of the null hypothesis is (W<sub>before</sub> - W<sub>after</sub>)<sub>diet</sub> <= (W<sub>before</sub> - W<sub>after</sub>)<sub>exercise</sub>

####2. "Do Americans trust the president?"

Null hypothesis: Among people who participated in the said poll, Democrats trusted the president(Bill Clinton) equally as or less than Republicans.

Formula: D<sub>poll</sub> and R<sub>poll</sub> are the numbers of Democrasts and Repblicans surveyed respectively. D<sub>trust</sub> and R<sub>trust</sub> are the numbers of Democrasts and Repblicans who responded yes to the question respectively.
The expression of the null hypothesis is D<sub>trust</sub> / D<sub>poll</sub> <= R<sub>trust</sub> / R<sub>poll</sub>

####3. "Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking."

Null hypothesis: After one month of experiment, smokers who use nicotine patches have the same or a lower cessation rate than those who use a placebo patch.

Formula: N<sub>nicotine</sub> and N<sub>placebo</sub> are the numbers of smokers assigned with nicotine and placebo patches respectively before the experiment. Q<sub>nicotine</sub> and Q<sub>placebo</sub> are the numbers of smokers who were assigned with nicotine and placebo patches and successfully quit smoking after the experiment, respectively.
The expression of the null hypothesis is Q<sub>nicotine</sub> / N<sub>nicotine</sub> <= Q<sub>placebo</sub> / N<sub>placebo</sub>

####4. "Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnangt woman."

Null hypothesis: Children born by women who smoke during pregnancy have the same or faster mental development rate than those who do not smoke during pregnancy.

Formula: R<sub>1</sub> = (IQ<sub>2</sub> - IQ<sub>1</sub>) / IQ<sub>1</sub>  IQ<sub>n</sub> is a child's IQ at age n. R<sub>1</sub> here measures the first IQ growth rate as child grows from 1 year old to 2 years old. Using the same method, we can get R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub> for the IQ growth rate from age 2-3 and age 3-4. Taking an average of R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub> will give us the average yearly IQ growth rate of an individual child. And if we study on enough children, it can be the average of that group children. In this case, we have a test group whose mothers smoked during pregancy ("s"), and the control group with mothers who didn't smoke ("ns").
The expression of the null hypothesis is (R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>3</sub>)/3 <sub>s</sub> >= (R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>3</sub>)/3 <sub>ns</sub>
