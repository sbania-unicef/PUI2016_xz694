Assignment 2:

Setting up environment on Compute and Creating another repository.

On my compute account, I use the command "vi .bashrc" to open the .bashrc file, and add the environment variable of PUI2016 and also the alias pui2016.

I save the vi file before existing, and then reconnect to the Compute to test whether they are permanently saved. Turns out that they are.
